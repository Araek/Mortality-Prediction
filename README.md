# Mortality-Prediction
This repository provides RapidMiner codes for Mortality Prediction.
It tested on MIMIC dataset.
It applies the ensemble Machine Learning model, the Gradient Boosting DecisionTree (GBDT).
An efficient cluster-based under-sampling method to handle imbalanced data is implemented (which is based on K-means).
